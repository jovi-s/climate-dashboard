            "1. **Initial Targets**: The first Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) set a baseline with a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario of 2.881 GtCO2-eq, which was slightly adjusted to 2.869 GtCO2-eq in the subsequent NDC.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Sector Focus**: The NDC emphasized major mitigation targets in the forest, land use, and energy sectors, which together account for about 97% of Indonesia's national commitment.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Updated NDC (2021)**: An Updated NDC was submitted in 2021, showcasing enhanced ambition in adaptation strategies and clearer mitigation efforts. This update aimed to align with the Paris Agreement's rules and address national development goals for 2020-2024.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Enhanced NDC (2022)**: By September 2022, Indonesia submitted an Enhanced NDC, increasing the emission reduction target from 29% to 31.89% unconditionally and from 41% to 43.20% conditionally.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Long-Term Goals**: The Enhanced NDC represents a transition towards Indonesia's Second NDC, which aims for net-zero emissions by 2060 or sooner, in line with the Long-Term Low Carbon and Climate Resilience Strategy (LTS-LCCR) for 2050.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the differences in Indonesia's climate targets and NDCs reflect a progressive enhancement in ambition, clarity, and alignment with international frameworks, focusing on multi-sectoral approaches and stakeholder engagement.\n",
